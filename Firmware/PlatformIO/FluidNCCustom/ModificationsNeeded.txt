To use the wallPlotter kenematic in fluidNC we need to create an option to configure the plotter's anchor spaces manually:

new items in the config file:

bool dynamicAnchors: tell it what config options to use
int stringReferencePoint: where we halt the plotter at each string length for configuration



homing process:

1 drive the plotter to where one string is pulled to the length set by the config
2 extend/restract other string until the plotter just sits vertically
3 log positions
4 drive plotter to where the other string is pulled to the length set by the config
5 extend/restract first string until the ploter just sits vertically
6 log positions

7 crunch numbers

see https://www.hackster.io/fredrikstridsman/stringent-the-15-wall-plotter-d965ca

d =  horizontal distance between anchors
l = stringReferencePoint, where we halt the plotter at each measure
m = extra distance we travelled on one wheel to get from distance A to B

d = sqrt( (l + m)^2 - l^2 )
(triangle formula, (hyp^2 - opp^2)^1/2 = adj)


to set this up, we could:
create a special G or Mcode to switch between X-Y converted positioning and direct spool positioning
if dynamicAnchors is found to be true, we will start with direct positioning enabled
we will have 2 variables that store the status of left and right configuration
we will not allow the user to leave direct spool positioning until left and right config has been found
optionally store these values to EEPROM

left position will be [-d/2,0]
right position will be [d/2,0]

starting coordinates:

____________d____________
|           |
|           |
| L         |
|           |
|_ _ _ _ _[0,0]



as we move in realtime with direct positioning, we will run the back-conversion code
to update cartesian position as well
if a left and right config message is sent, we will snap our head to one of the coordinates above
